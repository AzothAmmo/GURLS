Introduction
============

The GRAND UNIFIED LEAST SQUARES software library comprises the following packages.

-GURLS, a MATLAB software library for regression and (multiclass) classification 
based on the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) loss function. 
Datasets that fit into your computer's memory should be handled with this package.

-bGURLS (b is for big), a MATLAB software library that allows to use RLS on very large
matrices by means of memory-mapped storage and a simple distributed task manager.

-GURLS++, a C++ standalone implementation of GURLS.

-bGURLS++, a  C++ standalone implementation of bGURLS.

- Quick intructions on how to run the libraries for a default case can be found here: 
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/2-Getting-Started#wiki-Hello_World

- A User manual with several examples can be found here:
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/3-User-Manual#wiki-User_Manual

- A collection of the most useful and common pipelines can be found here:
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/3-User-Manual#wiki-Examples

- The list of all the available method of the libraries can be found at
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/4-Available-methods

- C++ Code Documentation can be generated with the following command
   $ doxygen Doxyfile.in
 and a pre-built version can be found in doc_gurls++.zip. The online version of the documentation will be soon available

- Further Documentation
	* Have a look at the README files of each individual package.
	
	* In gurls-manual.pdf you can find both the installation instructions and user manual, together with the Matlab and C++ Developer's Guide. GURLS is designed for easy expansion. Give it a try!

-Test
	Testing routines and scripts are available in the test directories of the gurls 
	and gurls++ package. This checks that gurls and gurls++ results coincide.
