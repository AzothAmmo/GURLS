Introduction
============

The GRAND UNIFIED LEAST SQUARES software library comprises the following packages.

- GURLS, a MATLAB software library for regression and (multiclass) classiﬁcation 
based on the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) loss function. 
Datasets that fit into your computer's memory should be handled with this package.

-bGURLS (b is for big), a MATLAB software library for regression and (multiclass) classiﬁcation 
based on the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) loss function. 
It can handle computations with very large matrices by means of memory-mapped storage 
and a simple distributed task manager.

- GURLS++, a C++ standalone implementation of GURLS.

-bGURLS++, a  C++ standalone implementation of bGURLS, currently under active development.

Documentation

=============


- User's Guide:
	A common gurls and gurls++ User's Guide describing the package organization and rationale, 
	as well as each available method is available in the gurls-manual.pdf file.

- C++ Code Documentation can be generated with the following command
	$ doxygen Doxyfile.in

- Matlab and C++ Developer's Guide
	Simple developer's guides for Matlab and C++ are available in the gurls-manual.pdf 
	file. GURLS is designed for easy expansion. Give it a try!

- Demos
	All packages have exstensively commented demos in the "demo"
	subdirectory of each package. We feel this is the best way to learn how
	to use these packages.

-Test
	Testing routines and scripts are available in the test directories of the gurls 
	and gursl++ package. This checks that gurls and gurls++ results coincide.

- Further Documentation
	* Have a look at the README files of each individual package.

	* A collection of the most useful and common pipelines can be found here:
	  https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/User-Manual

Quick and Dirty
===============


While we have put a considerable effort in making the GURLS
package versatile and yet self contained, we do understand that sometimes
you just want to run it!

Have a look at the README file inside the "gurls" directory for quick intructions on
how to install and run the package for a default case.
