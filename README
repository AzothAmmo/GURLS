Introduction
===========

The GRAND UNIFIED LEAST SQUARES toolbox comprises three software packages.

- GURLS, a MATLAB software package for training multiclass classifiers based on the
reguarised least squares algorithm. Datasets that fit into your computer's memory
should be handled with this package.

-bGURLS (b is for big) a MATLAB software package
for training linear multiclass classifiers based on the Regularized Least Squares
(RLS) loss function, it uses a home brewed memory mapped file system and a simple
distributed task manager to allow for training from very large datasets.

- gurls++ a C++ standalone implementation of GURLS. This package is
under active development but it's not very well documented as of right now.
The linear case is mostly covered and has been succesfully tested.

Documentation
=============

- User's Guide:
	A User's Guide with help files for each available method is available
	in the gurls-documentation.pdf file.

- Developer's Guide
	A simple developer's guide is available in the gurls-documentation.pdf file.
	GURLS is designed for easy expansion. Give it a try!

- Demos
	Both GURLS and bGURLS have exstensively commented demos in the "demo"
	subdirectory of each package. We feel this is the best way to learn how
	to use these packages.

- Further Documentation
	* Have a look at the README files of each individual package.

	* A collection of the most useful and common pipelines can be found here:

Quick and Dirty
===============


While we have put a considerable effort in making the GURLS
package versatile and yet self contained, we do understand that sometimes
you just want to run it!

Have a look at the README file inside the "gurls" directory for quick intructions on
how to install and run the package for a default case.
