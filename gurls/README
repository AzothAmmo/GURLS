Introduction
===========

GURLS - (Grand Unified Regularized Least Squares) is a MATLAB software package
for training multiclass classifiers based on the Regularized Least Squares
(RLS) loss function.

- Automatic parameter selection.
- Handle massive datasets.
- Great modularity, each method can be used independently.
- Wide range of optimization routines.

Installation
============

Open MATLAB and execute:

>> run('PACKAGE_ROOT/gurls/utils/gurls_install.m');

where PACKAGEROOT is where you unzipped the GURLS package.
This will add all the important directories to your path. Run 'savepath' if
you want the installation to be permanent.

Documentation
=============

Have a look, and run gurlsdemo.m in the 'demo' subdirectory, and refer to
single the documentation of single functions for further reference.  The most
popular learning pipelines are outlined here, with example code:
https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/User-Manual

Quick and Dirty
===============

Put your training data in a n-by-d matrix X with each row being a data sample.
Put the training labels in a y n-by-one vector. Let the labels go from 1 to T with T 
being the number of classes.

Run:

>> opt = gurls_train(X,y);

Put your test data in a n-by-d matrix Xte like above and your test labels in 
a n-by-one vector yte. Let the labels go from 1 to T with T being the number of classes.

Run: 

>> [yhat, acc] = gurls_test(Xte,yte,opt)

This will train a linear model in the dual space using leave-one-out cross validation.
