GURLS - (Grand Unified Regularized Least Squares) is a MATLAB software package
for training multiclass classifiers based on the Regularized Least Squares
(RLS) loss function.

- Automatic parameter selection.
- Handle massive datasets.
- Great modularity, each method can be used independently.
- Wide range of optimization routines.
